 # If there is only one command to run with switches then
 # only Cmd needs to be set
 Cmd: "ps -ef"
 # Pipe is used when the output from the Cmd above needs
 # to be sent into another command
 # such as ps -ef | grep chrome
 # Don't add the pipe sign.
 # Currently only one pipe is supported
 # Ex.
 # Cmd: ps -ef
 Pipe: "grep chrom"
 # is the equivalent of:  ps -ef |grep chrom
 #
 # For commands that modify, restart services, or create a security event provide a scenario to the user
 # so they have some context to the problem.
 # Or just ask the user what command was used to generate the output
