			Command: <input type="text" name="Cmd" value="">

			# Pipe is used when the output from the Cmd above needs<br />
			# to be sent into another command<br />
			# such as ps -ef | grep chrome<br />
			# Don't add the pipe sign.<br />
			# Currently only one pipe is supported<br />
			# Ex.<br />
			# Cmd: ps -ef<br />
			
			Pipe <input type="text" size="20" name="Pipe" value="">

			<textarea cols="20" rows="10" name="msg" value=""></textarea>
			<p>
			# is the equivalent of:  ps -ef |grep chrom<br />
			#<br />
			# For commands that modify, restart services, or create a security event provide a scenario to the user<br />
			# so they have some context to the problem.<br />
			# Or just ask the user what command was used to generate the output.<br />
